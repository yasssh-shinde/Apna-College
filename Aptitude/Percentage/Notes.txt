🔄 To convert % to fraction: divide by 100
🔄 To convert fraction to %: multiply by 100

📈 Increase/Decrease Formula
Increase %:
New Value = Old Value × (1 + (Increase% / 100))

Decrease %:
New Value = Old Value × (1 − (Decrease% / 100))




🧮 Successive Percentage Change Formula:
Net % Change = A + B + (A × B)/100
(Use + for increase and − for decrease)

👉 Example: A = +20%, B = −10%
Net = 20 − 10 + (20×−10)/100 = 10 − 2 = 8% increase

🤝 Comparison of Quantities
If A is x% more than B, then
B is less than A by = (x / (100 + x)) × 100%

If A is x% less than B, then
B is more than A by = (x / (100 − x)) × 100%




🧠 Important Tricks
x% of y = y% of x
E.g. 25% of 40 = 40% of 25

If price increases by x%, consumption must decrease by (x / (100 + x)) × 100% to maintain same expenditure.

If population increases/decreases successively, use successive % change formula.




✅ 1. Find % of a Number
Q1. What is 30% of 250?
👉 Solution: (30/100) × 250 = 75

Q2. What is 12.5% of 400?
👉 Solution: (12.5/100) × 400 = 50

🔺 2. Percentage Increase/Decrease
Q3. A shirt price increased from ₹800 to ₹880. Find the % increase.
👉 Increase = 880 − 800 = 80
% Increase = (80 / 800) × 100 = 10%

Q4. A fan price decreased from ₹2000 to ₹1800. Find the % decrease.
👉 Decrease = 2000 − 1800 = 200
% Decrease = (200 / 2000) × 100 = 10%

🔁 3. Successive % Change
Q5. A value increases by 20% and then decreases by 10%. What is net % change?
👉 Use formula: A + B + (A×B)/100
= 20 − 10 + (20×−10)/100 = 10 − 2 = 8% increase

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 4. Population-based Question
Q6. Town population = 40,000. It increases by 5% annually. What will be population after 1 year?
👉 New = 40,000 × (1 + 5/100) = 40,000 × 1.05 = 42,000

Q7. Population decreases by 4%. Current = 50,000. What was it last year?
👉 Last Year = 50,000 / 0.96 = 52,083.33

💰 5. Income–Expenditure–Savings
Q8. Income = ₹20,000, Expenditure = ₹15,000. What is saving %?
Saving = 20,000 − 15,000 = ₹5,000
% Saving = (5,000 / 20,000) × 100 = 25%

Q9. Income = ₹25,000, Savings = ₹5,000. What is expenditure %?
Expenditure = 25,000 − 5,000 = 20,000
% Expenditure = (20,000 / 25,000) × 100 = 80%

🏫 6. Exam Score – Pass/Fail %
Q10. Out of 500 students, 400 passed. Find the pass percentage.
Pass % = (400 / 500) × 100 = 80%

Q11. 120 students failed out of 800. What is the failure %?
Fail % = (120 / 800) × 100 = 15%

💹 7. Profit-Loss % based on CP/SP
Q12. CP = ₹500, SP = ₹600. Find profit %.
Profit = 100 ⇒ (100 / 500) × 100 = 20%

Q13. CP = ₹1,200, SP = ₹1,000. Find loss %.
Loss = 200 ⇒ (200 / 1200) × 100 = 16.67%
